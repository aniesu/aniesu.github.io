    <p id="about-p">My name is Anie Sucuqui and I am from Providence, Rhode Island. I am a student at the University of Rhode Island, where 
    I am studying <br> to earn my BS in Biotechnology. During my free time I enjoy going to the beach, watching the sunset as well as running and hiking. <br>
    I also enjoy traveling. I have visited several countries and had the opportunity to immerse myself in new cultures and meet wonderful people.
